# Keypad-By-ADC
In this project, I was looking for a method of building a tiny keypad that could be attached to just one pin of the controller. Push button switches make up the keypad, and they are wired so that each switch outputs its own voltage, which the ADC senses using a voltage divider. By pressing two or more switches simultaneously and generating different voltages, we can use that connection to build additional functionality. I used an LCD to display the switches that were pressed and a UART to relay this data to my computer.
