# Keypad-By-ADC
 In this project, I was trying to find a way to create a small keypad that can be connected to only one pin of the controller. The keypad consists of push button switches that are connected in a way that every switch delivers its own voltage that is sensed by the ADC by using a voltage divider. That connection allows us to create extra functionalities by pressing two or more switches at the same time, creating various volts. I used LCD to show the pressed switches also used UART to send this data to my personal computer.
